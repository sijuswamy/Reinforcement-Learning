<p>Reinforcement learning is learning what to do-how to map situations to actions-so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards. These two characteristics- trial- and-error search and delayed reward-are the two most important distinguishing features of reinforcement learning.</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning, like many topics whose names end with &ldquo;ing,&rdquo; such as machine learning and mountaineering, is simultaneously a problem, a class of solution methods that work well on the problem, and the field that studies this problem and its solution methods. It is convenient to use a single name for all three things, but at the same time essential to keep the three conceptually separate.</p>
