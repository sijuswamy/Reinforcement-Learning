      <description>Today morning I was watching the andakshary game played by my neighbouring boys. They have sing many songs as part of the game. By chance Achu sing the Malayalam Christian funeral song starting with the malayalam word &amp;lsquo;Samayamaam&amp;hellip;.&#39;. Suddenly his father jumped into the seen and he scolded the boys saying that &amp;lsquo;Did your father die?&amp;hellip; idiots.&#39;.
This incident remind me one of the psychology lesson taught by my favourite Professor- Jose Augustine during my graduation in Education.</description>

      <description>Introduction“Learn from the past , live in present and plan your future”
This is one of the motivational quote from Sri. Sri. Ravisankar. If you can understand its meaning, then you can understand the Reinforcement Learning. Inorder to complete a task every one need a minimum level of skill. A man usually takes much of his time to acquire skills formally or informally. if we can understand how to acquire a new skill, we can enable human species to do things we might not have thought before.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is learning what to do-how to map situations to actions-so as to maximize a numerical reward signal. The learner is not told which actions to take, but instead must discover which actions yield the most reward by trying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate reward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards.</description>

      <description>Markov Chain Mote-Carlo Sampling TechniqueI was explaining the MCMC sampling algorithm in my AI&amp;amp;ML class. Suddenly a student asked me “Sir, Can you give a simple slimily to explain this algorithm?” I freezed for a moment. Any way I told them this story.
Long ago… at the time of Mr. Markov’s graduation, he had only one intimate friend. He has decided to expand his friendship. But his parents taught him that friends should have good quality like Mr.</description>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:
