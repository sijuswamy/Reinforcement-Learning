      <description>Today morning I was watching the andakshary game played by my neighbouring boys. They have sing many songs as part of the game. By chance Achu sing the Malayalam Christian funeral song starting with the malayalam word &amp;lsquo;Samayamaam&amp;hellip;.&#39;. Suddenly his father jumped into the seen and he scolded the boys saying that &amp;lsquo;Did your father die?&amp;hellip; idiots.&#39;.
This incident remind me one of the psychology lesson taught by my favourite Professor- Jose Augustine during my graduation in Education.</description>

      <description>Introduction“Learn from the past , live in present and plan your future”
This is one of the motivational quote from Sri. Sri. Ravisankar. If you can understand its meaning, then you can understand the Reinforcement Learning. Inorder to complete a task every one need a minimum level of skill. A man usually takes much of his time to acquire skills formally or informally. if we can understand how to acquire a new skill, we can enable human species to do things we might not have thought before.</description>
