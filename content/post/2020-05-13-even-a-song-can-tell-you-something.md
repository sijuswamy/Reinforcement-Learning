Today morning I was watching the andakshary game played by my neighbouring boys. They have sing many songs as part of the game. By chance Achu sing the Malayalam Christian funeral song starting with the malayalam word 'Samayamaam....'. Suddenly his father jumped into the seen and he scolded the boys saying that 'Did your father die?... idiots.'. 

This incident remind me one of the psychology lesson taught by my favourite Professor- Jose Augustine during my graduation in Education. It is Pavlov's theory. Why the father made such harsh words? Can you guess?. The reason is _conditioning_. This funeral song is played only during funeral service. So naturally this song creates a connection with death. 

During the 1890s, Russian physiologist, Ivan Pavlov was researching salivation in dogs in response to being fed. Pavlov predicted the dogs would salivate in response to the food placed in front of them, but he noticed that his dogs would begin to salivate whenever they heard the footsteps of his assistant who was bringing them the food. According to him food is an unconditioned stimulus and salivation is an unconditioned response. (i.e., a stimulus-response connection that required no learning).  food is an unconditioned stimulus and salivation is an unconditioned response. (i.e., a stimulus-response connection that required no learning). Pavlov used a metronome (hand bell) as his neutral stimulus. By itself the metronome did not elicit a response from the dogs. Pavlov began the conditioning procedure, whereby the clicking metronome was introduced just before he gave food to his dogs. After a number of repeats (trials) of this procedure he presented the metronome on its own.

As you might expect, the sound of the clicking metronome on its own now caused an increase in salivation. So the dog had learned an association between the metronome and the food and a new behaviour had been learned. Because this response was learned (or conditioned), it is called a conditioned response (and also known as a Pavlovian response). The neutral stimulus has become a conditioned stimulus.

In our boys song, same conditioning happens. We can see lot of such conditioning in our life. Smell of dhoops, Mandras and other prayers used in temple or church etc.., conditioned us. This is unintentional but some times intentional too. It is the beginning of Reinforcement Learning. Interesting.. No?
